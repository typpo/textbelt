### TextBelt Open Source

TextBelt Open Source is a REST API that sends outgoing SMS.  It uses a free mechanism for sending texts, different from the more reliable paid version available at https://textbelt.com.

This project uses carrier-specific gateways to deliver your text messages for free, and without ads.  The service is fairly reliable when configured on a private server and has sent over 1 million texts.

Send a text with a simple POST request:

```sh
$ curl -X POST http://my_textbelt_server/text \
   -d number=5551234567 \
   -d "message=I sent this message for free with Textbelt"
```

`number` and `message` parameters are required.

If you are using the paid version at https://textbelt.com, run the following (more examples available on the homepage):

```sh
$ curl -X POST https://textbelt.com/text \
   -d number=5551234567 \
   -d "message=I sent this message for free with Textbelt" \
   -d key=abcdef123456
```

### Success and Failure
Sample success:

```json
{"success":true}
```

Note that success means that the message was sent to Textbelt's list of providers.  We can't guarantee delivery on your network.

Sample failure:

```json
{"success":false,"message":"Exceeded quota for this phone number."}
```

### Usage as a module

Though this repository contains an express server so you may run your own
instance of the web app, you may also use it to send text messages in your
project.

#### Configuration:

This project uses [`nodemailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) for sending emails. Set up `lib/config.js` with the following:

- **`transport`** should be a Nodemailer transport [documented here](https://nodemailer.com/plugins/create/#transports)
- **`mailOptions`** fields should include at least include the `from` field, but you can include any of the fields [documented here](https://nodemailer.com/message/).

A sample transport with SMTP sending is included.

For example, to send a text using the default settings:

```js
var text = require('textbelt');

text.send('9491234567', 'A sample text message!', undefined, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
});
```

You can also supply a region (valid choices are `us`, `intl`, or `canada`)

```js
var text = require('textbelt');

// Canada
text.send('9491234567', 'A sample text message!', 'canada', function(err) {
...
});

// International
text.send('1119491234567', 'Bonjour!', 'intl', function(err) {
...
});
```

### Usage as a standalone server

Textbelt can be run as a standalone server with: `node server/app.js`.  Be sure to install dependencies first with `npm install` and you've configured nodemailer in `lib/config.js`. This project also relies on redis. To install redis locally, please see the [redis documentation](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart). Before launching the app, ensure redis is running on port 6379 with `redis-server`.

By default, the server listens on port 9090.

Don't forget to set `fromAddress` in `lib/config.js` to the email address you want to send from.

### Canadian and International endpoints

The /text endpoint supports U.S. phone numbers (and parts of Canada).

For Canadian texts, curl `http://textbelt.com/canada`.

For international texts, curl `http://textbelt.com/intl`.

Canadian and international support may not be complete.  Refer to the list of supported carriers.

### Notes and Limitations

 * Some carriers are picky about which messages they deliver. A "success" response from Textbelt means that your message was given to the carrier.

 *  Some carriers may deliver text messages from "txt@textbelt.com", "foo@bar.com", or whatever you have configured as `fromAddress` in `lib/config.js`.
